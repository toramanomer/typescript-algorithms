# Linear Search

Linear search is a searching algorithm that sequentially checks each element in a list until the desired element is found or the sequence ends.

## Time Complexity

-   **Best Case:** **O(1)** (Element found at the beginning)
-   **Worst Case:** **O(n)** (Element at the end or not present)

# Binary Search

Binary search is a searching algorithm that find the desiired element in a **sorted** sequence by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half until the target is found or the interval is empty.

## Time Complexity

-   **Best Case:** **O(1)** (Element is in the middle)
-   **Worst Case:** **O(log n)** (Element at the end or not present)
