# Linear Search

Linear search is a searching algorithm that sequentially checks each element in a list until the desired element is found or the sequence ends.

## Time Complexity

-   **Best Case:** **O(1)** (Element found at the beginning)
-   **Worst Case:** **O(n)** (Element at the end or not present)
